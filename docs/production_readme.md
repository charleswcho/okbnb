### Single-Page App



```ruby
class Api::SessionsController < ApplicationController
    def get_user
      if current_user
        render :current_user
      else
        render json: errors.full_messages
      end
    end
 end
  ```

### Note Rendering and Editing

  On the database side, the notes are stored in one table in the database, which contains columns for `id`, `user_id`, `content`, and `updated_at`.  Upon login, an API call is made to the database which joins the user table and the note table on `user_id` and filters by the current user's `id`.  These notes are held in the `NoteStore` until the user's session is destroyed.  

  Notes are rendered in two different components: the `CondensedNote` components, which show the title and first few words of the note content, and the `ExpandedNote` components, which are editable and show all note text.  The `NoteIndex` renders all of the `CondensedNote`s as subcomponents, as well as one `ExpandedNote` component, which renders based on `NoteStore.selectedNote()`. The UI of the `NoteIndex` is taken directly from Evernote for a professional, clean look:

Note editing is implemented using the Quill.js library, allowing for a Word-processor-like user experience.

### Notebooks

Implementing Notebooks started with a notebook table in the database.  The `Notebook` table contains two columns: `title` and `id`.  Additionally, a `notebook_id` column was added to the `Note` table.  

The React component structure for notebooks mirrored that of notes: the `NotebookIndex` component renders a list of `CondensedNotebook`s as subcomponents, along with one `ExpandedNotebook`, kept track of by `NotebookStore.selectedNotebook()`.  

`NotebookIndex` render method:

```javascript
render: function () {
  return ({this.state.notebooks.map(function (notebook) {
    return <CondensedNotebook notebook={notebook} />
  }
  <ExpandedNotebook notebook={this.state.selectedNotebook} />)
}
```
